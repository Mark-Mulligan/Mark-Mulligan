## About Me

Hi! I'm Mark, a software developer based in Dallas, TX. I currently work as a full stack developer for Visual Storage Intelligence where I support all levels of the VSI application. Our application, built using Python / React / Node.js / MSSQL provides in-depth enterprise storage analytics and reporting. Because of this, I have a lot of experience working with advanced data visuallization and robust, dynamic websites with ever changing data.
