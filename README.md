### [Fluency Forge](https://www.fluencyforge.com/)

#### Built with Next.js, supabase, and tailwind

Fluency Forge is an educational platform designed to teach users the Japanese character system. It offers fully-fledged courses adapted from textbooks, turning them into immersive learning experiences. Fluency Forge includes a range of features to enhance your learning, such as performance tracking to identify areas where you need improvement, a customizable review mode to focus on the concepts you're working on, and comprehensive courses that integrate seamlessly across the platform. Additionally, it provides an extensive library to help you quickly look up any information you need for deeper understanding.

### [US Housing Data](https://us-housing-data.vercel.app/)

#### Built With Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Recharts

I built this application to allow me to track the United State's housing market. The charts quickly allow you to look at trends in the housing market based on historical data gathered from the last five years. The data was provided by relator.com

### [Invoice Generator](https://lesson-invoice-generator.netlify.app/)

#### Built with Next.js, MUI, Firebase, Next/auth, React-PDF, AWS SES, AWS Lambdas, AWS API Gateway, AWS SNS Topics

I built this application for one of my friends who is a private music teacher. He spends a lot of time putting together invoices for the parents of the students he teachers each month. This program is designed to streamline that process. I also included a way to save and organize a roster of students. This data is present to the user in the form of table to can be easily searched and sorted. I used google oauth to login in the users, firebase to store all the necessary data, and the react-pdf package to create and generate professional invoices that can be downloaded and used as needed.
