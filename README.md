## Projects

Here are some of my latest projects I have been working on.

[Just Code](https://just-code1.netlify.app/)
This project was created to help people learn how to code with javascript. I found that a lot of sights like hacker rank and leet code are good for studying advanced concepts, but not so great for people learning how to code. I created this site to help others learn how to code by creating simple straightforward problems to solve. These problems are also inspired from problems I have had to solve in my day to day job, instead of just fancy algorithmic problems meant to trip you up.

[Invoice Generator](https://lesson-invoice-generator.netlify.app/)
I built this application for one of my friends who is a private music teacher. He spends a lot of time putting together invoices for the parents of the students he teachers each month. This program is designed to streamline that process. I also included a way to save and organize a roster of students. This data is present to the user in the form of table to can be easily searched and sorted. I used google oauth to login in the users, firebase to store all the necessary data, and the react-pdf package to create and generate professional invoices that can be downloaded and used as needed.

[Better Music](https://bettermusic.netlify.app/)
I built this project to learn Next.js while taking the opportunity to work on my UI/UX design skills. I heard great things about Next and after using it, I am hooked. Static generation was perfect for this site along with dynamic routing. The image optimization was extremely useful as well. As a bonus, I challenged my self to build everything from scratch. No additional libraries or packages were used in building this project. I learned a ton from doing this and am glad I took the opportunity to do so.

[Outdoor Adventures](https://outdoor-adventures1.netlify.app/)
Full Stack app that let's you explore all the national parks. Search and filter through all parks and click on a park in the table to view an individual page for that park.
